  talking about writing fortran code
  rather poor suggestions
  variable names:
    start with characters
    char, digits and _ only, probably use snake case

  experimental notes:
    no out of index warnings if you try to assign out of bounds on arrays?
    correction:
      segmentation fault occured when tried to assign to 13th place on a len-10 array
