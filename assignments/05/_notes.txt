1)
  implement an n-set rk4 S.T
    takes
      function for each derivative vector variable (all but one of initial conditions)
      initial conditions
      step size
    returns
      evolved initial conditions
    derivative function should be structured so that it returns a vector of same size as variables
  usage module will
    include
      definitions for functions
      function for storing path in file
2)
  implement adaptive rk4
    a overarching controller takes
      function describing derivatives
      initial conditions
      initial step size
      optional duration (default 10.0)
      optional max step count (default 10000)
      optional precision control (default 10**-6)
    using the single step rk4
      take 2 steps with stepSize
        call it smallSteps
      take 1 step with 2*stepSize
        call it bigStep
