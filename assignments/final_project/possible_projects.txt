lattice response project
  --summary
  generate a large number of bodies that interact over short distances
  impose a binding a potential/periodic boundary conditions
  use a cell list to make force evaluation a ~constant effort function
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_lists
  explore angle and driving frequency response
  --challenges
  initializing system
  implementing cell list
  storing results
  deciding how interaction forces take place
  deciding how to assert ambient/driving forces
  displaying results
  validating solver

double pendulum exploration project
  --summary
  set up numerical solver to double pendulum system
  generate these images https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Double_pendulum_flips_graph.png for various parameters
  possibly play around with using clusters for parallelism
  --challenges
  subdividing problem
  learning how to dispatch to cluster
  displaying results
  validating solver

finding uranus project
  --summary
  using http://www.astro-phys.com/api ephemiris API get historical data on planet location
  using a n-body gravity solver to simulate the solar system find deviations when uranus is neglected
  use least-squares process to make predictions about where uranus /should/ be
  --challenges
  validating solver
  deciding how interaction forces take place
  learning enough about least-squares
  deciding on a search algorithm
  extra: playing with the input precision to see how it impacts output precision

supposing gaussian potential
u0*e^(-x^2/l^2)
force is
-u0 2 x l^-2 e^(-x^2/l^2)
extrema in force is where
-u0 2 l^-2 e^(-x^2/l^2) + u0 4 x^2 l^-4 e^(-x^2/l^2)=0
or
[ x^2 - l^2/2 ] u0 4 l^-4 e^(-x^2/l^2)=0
