  ? what methods exist for determining if a physics problem has an analytic solution before we've found said solution?
  taking advantage of generated errors to improve solution
  numerical solutions almost intrinsically approximate

  1: introduction
    accuracy in computing
    f90
    local interpolation and splines
    definte integrals, trapezoidal rule, romberg integration and adaptive
      talking about how errors in interpolation lead to errors in integration
  2: ODEs
    linear and nonlinear ODes
    initial value problems: RK and adaptive methods
    boundary value problems: shooting and finite difference methods
  3: PDEs
    parabolic (diffusion), elliptic (Poisson), hyperbolic (wave+advection)
    finite difference and finite element spatial discretization
    explicit, semi-implicit and implicit time-stepping schemes
    stability analysis
