main program starts on line 40
opens input file and output file
sets x and y values on loop 42-44
calls 2nd derivative function on line 54 interface defined 14-21
  actual 2nd derivative defined 73-113
  cubic spline defined 116-134
  bisect search is 137-173
  thomas algorithm is mostly implementing this
